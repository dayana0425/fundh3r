# Fund H3r - ETH NYC Project
One-stop shop to donate crypto to organizations supporting women's reproductive rights. (worldwide starting with the US). 

# Problem

The problem we are solving for is the existence of scattered information on how to donate to organizations working on sexual reproductive rights, donors being scammed, and lack of visibility on acceptance of crypto as a donation. 

The solution we developed aggregates information on NGO's working on sexual reproductive rights in one easy-to-use site for crypto donors and onboards NGO's that do not accept crypto donations yet.

# Solution

Enable Crypto donations to support women reproductive rights by: onboarding non-profits to diversify their funding options while aggregating their information in one site.

# More Info
This project serves two types of users through a decentralized app: NGO's that have not been onboarded into crypto and crypto donors. 

The app includes a form that triggers the creation of a Gnosis Safe, with an ENS domain assigned to it, for newcomer NGOs to enable the reception of Ethereum crypto donations. The use of these funds is time-sensitive, we use EPNS to alert NGOs of the reception of any new funds for speedy deployment. 

For donors, we index the chain to display on one website all donation recipients to this cause through a Subgraph and enable donations through multiple wallets by using Wallet Connect. 

Womenâ€™s reproductive rights are a sensitive topic and companies involved are often targeted by malicious actors, to resist possible attacks on our site we store a backup in multiple nodes through decentralized storage.
